<h3 id="the-entertainers&#39;-secret-from-western-medication"><a href="https://open.spotify.com/album/534dMfCrMyW8c4cKUR2ci2">The Entertainers&#39; Secret</a> from <a href="https://www.facebook.com/westernmeds">Western Medication</a></h3>
<p>The only logic behind any punk is that you dance to it with abandon and some shade of joy, ideally in direct contrast to the tone. Here on your doorstep the real deal waits for you to return from somewhere you&#39;d rather not be. Open it. Put it on. Leave the windows open.</p>
<h3 id="limn-from-jeremy-gara"><a href="https://open.spotify.com/album/4uROmNbnu71yyOPefIYQGS">Limn</a> from <a href="http://www.nrcssindustry.com/news-1/2016/1/9/3jnkb3qs2f902hzlvgadbyebj6yggq">Jeremy Gara</a></h3>
<p>If you&#39;ve ever had a robot break up with you at lunch in a deserted restaurant with terrible service, if you&#39;ve ever wandered down through an underpass to see if you could spend the night comfortably just in case, if you&#39;re waiting on Grandaddy getting back together before you plan your wedding, then stop. Skip your next pack of cigarettes, your next burrito, and buy this record. Go to your wisting spot, listen until you hear the practiced dying organist on <a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/5CEHGYIluK0kELwgHEDWbq">The Dupe</a>, repeat.</p>
<h3 id="the-ridges-from-diamondstein"><a href="https://open.spotify.com/album/3v6wOwg72s6aI81bnuaJ3e">The Ridges</a> from <a href="https://www.instagram.com/diamondsteinmusic/">Diamondstein</a></h3>
<p>I found myself inside the original Castlevania beside a weeping Juelz Santana overcome by his own 8bitness.</p>
<h3 id="wall-from-wall"><a href="https://open.spotify.com/album/7e2oOaJ7MjZfRIomP5RKO1">Wall</a> from <a href="http://www.wearewall.com/">Wall</a></h3>
<p>The top skill you need in new acquaintances is the ability to beat up three to five bullies while laughing and spitting half-formed complaints out one side of their mouth. Good thing you introduced yourself to each member of Wall and gave them all loaves of the finest, most medicinal zucchini bread. They got you / you got them.</p>
<h3 id="memory-care-unit-from-secret-boyfriend"><a href="https://open.spotify.com/album/2HXjhSA9QdnE6oPHmvXolG">Memory Care Unit</a> from <a href="http://blackesteverblack.com/artists/secret-boyfriend/">Secret Boyfriend</a></h3>
<p>Sometimes you have to sit down and nurse a warm glass and appreciate that a particular thing is over without resorting to nostalgia or any emotion that could be construed that way by your always-present-but-not-real detractors (enemies). At no additional charge soak yourself in this album, really thirty-five minutes of doneness that someone happened to capture in audio form as a contingency, a hedge.</p>
<h3 id="ghost-cop-from-ghost-cop"><a href="https://open.spotify.com/album/1ahUFRxrFQ6XksL62gWwuq">Ghost Cop</a> from <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ghostc0p">Ghost Cop</a></h3>
<p>The persistent, consistent, dull pull of montage as a substitute for memory. A superior form, really. It&#39;s a graying October afternoon in The Village as someone else has remembered it for you in the latest late seventies. She strides down the street, hair in her eyes, her mind made up about something, hopefully her charcoals or a novella. Some things have two hearts and two eyes.</p>
<h3 id="below-empty-&amp;-westward-bound-from-darts"><a href="https://open.spotify.com/album/6hcXrIt3lGleAmg2cqtMQj">Below Empty &amp; Westward Bound</a> from <a href="http://dartsmusic.com">Darts</a></h3>
<p>To start at the surface, Below Empty &amp; Westward Bound is a straight-up Western tragedy as told by pre-we&#39;ll-all-float-on-okay Modest Mouse. More precisely, imagine The Moon &amp; Antarctica were one-third as sad, four times as desperate, and was recorded in a single afternoon after one or more of the Modest Mouse people had killed a man to defend the honor of their fellow woman/horse/man. Certainly the only way to spend that time other than splitting up and sprinting from the law is to write down how you&#39;ll split up and sprint from the law or leave behind all the aspects of your life slash eat cold bags of half-eaten fast food just beyond the edge of the highway.</p>
