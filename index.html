<p>The only logic behind any punk is that you dance to it with abandon and some shade of joy, ideally in direct contrast to the tone. Here on your doorstep the real deal waits for you to return from somewhere you&#39;d rather not be. Open it. Put it on. Leave the windows open. </p>

<h3 id="below-empty-&amp;-westward-bound-from-darts"><a href="https://open.spotify.com/album/6hcXrIt3lGleAmg2cqtMQj">Below Empty &amp; Westward Bound</a> from <a href="http://dartsmusic.com">Darts</a></h3>
<p>To start at the surface, Below Empty &amp; Westward Bound is a straight-up Western tragedy as told by pre-we&#39;ll-all-float-on-okay Modest Mouse. More precisely, imagine The Moon &amp; Antarctica were one-third as sad, four times as desperate, and was recorded in a single afternoon after one or more of the Modest Mouse people had killed a man to defend the honor of their fellow woman/horse/man. Certainly the only way to spend that time other than splitting up and sprinting from the law is to write down how you&#39;ll split up and sprint from the law or leave behind all the aspects of your life slash eat cold bags of half-eaten fast food just beyond the edge of the highway.</p>
